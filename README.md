Hex2RGB is a simple app that I created for myself to calculate the CGfloat values for `(NSColor *)colorWithCalibratedRed:(CGFloat)red green:(CGFloat)green blue:(CGFloat)blue alpha:(CGFloat)alpha` from hex color codes. It's pretty badly written, actually. Everything is in the App delegate and there is no optimization, but hey, it works. Now that I think of it, the easier thing to do would have been to make a category to NSColor that takes hex values. Anyway, this is what it is.
